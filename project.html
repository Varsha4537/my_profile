								<h2><b>University Projects</b></h2>
								<p>I have built a diverse set of academic and personal projects that showcase my skills across data analytics, machine learning, systems programming, and full-stack development.</p>
								<p><b>Key highlights include:</b> <br>
									Machine Learning Models - ANN for customer churn prediction, CNN for ship classification, and dry bean classification.<br>
									Systems Programming - custom memory manager in C, bash shell integration, interprocess communication, and file manipulation tools.<br>
									Python Applications - expense trackers with SQLite, a photo editor, a banking app, and a mini-curl web renderer.<br>
									Full-Stack & Frontend Projects - a Flask app and a full-stack web platform with authentication and file uploads.<br>
									These projects reflect my ability to solve problems across data science, software development, and system design, combining both academic learning and practical implementation.<br>
									Check out the projects following the github link below! ðŸ¤—
